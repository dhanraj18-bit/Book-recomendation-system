## Project Statement
This project aims to develop a *Book Recommendation System* that suggests books to a target user based on the reading preferences and ratings of similar users. The system implements *Collaborative Filtering using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient*, enabling personalized and data-driven recommendations without requiring manual book selection.

The system analyzes the similarity between users, predicts ratings for books the user has not read, and ranks them in the form of top recommendations. It includes a *Tkinter-based Graphical User Interface* that allows the user to:

- Select a target user
- View their current book ratings
- View the most similar users and similarity scores
- View recommended books with predicted ratings

The application is built entirely in *Python*, runs offline, and can be scaled to support additional users and books.

---

## Objective
To create a user-friendly and intelligent system that automatically recommends books by identifying patterns in user behavior rather than relying on manual searches or predefined categories.

---

## Scope of the Project
- Limited to book recommendations based on numerical rating datasets
- Uses Pearson Correlation for user similarity calculation
- Handles dataset directly through dictionaries without external database
- Designed for educational and research purposes under Vityarthi Program, VIT Bhopal
